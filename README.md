Comments
--------

This is my only not tested Ruby code and I am not proud of it. When I started writing this game I had no idea how to do it and test it.

However now, after some refactoring I can see some code which could (and should) be tested. If I am going to write any other game, then I am going follow TDD. At least for testable objects.
